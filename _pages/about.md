I am a Ph.D. student at Texas State University major in Computer Science. I have a strong research background with expertise in using Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods to analyze time-series data and image data.

My dissertation topic is to solve EEG (Electroencephalography) data shortage problem when training on very deep Deep Learning models. Both supervised and unsupervised training methods are used. Other than that, I have done some research work on deep learning model compressions, deep learning on edge devices, and efficient computer graphics rendering pipelines.
